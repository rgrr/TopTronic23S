# TopTronic 23S Games


## Motivation 

I have a remote TopTronic 23S heating control installation, so the idea is clear to at least monitor the device.

Fortunately there has been done some groundworks.  These are:

* link:https://github.com/bogeyman/gallipoli[bogeyman/gallipoli] - the root of all exploration in this direction.  Unfortunately development stopped 9 years ago...
* link:https://github.com/tmuehlhoff/ceta/wiki/Protocol[tmuehlhoff/ceta] - wiki page of a different but similar protocol
* link:https://github.com/phiresky/ebv-theta-to-mqtt[phiresky/ebv-theta-to-mqtt] - EbV Theta to MQTT, again similar but different.  But I like the code behind

As said, currently I'm trying to figure out, how to monitor measurements from the TopTronic.  This consists of reading the data stream and send it to my raspi@home.


## Hardware On-Site

The hardware on-site consists of a Raspi5 (2 GByte) and an link:https://www.pi-shop.ch/usb-to-rs232-485-serial-converter-onboard-original-ft232rnl-chip[RS485 USB dongle].
It is connecting to my raspi@home via ssh automatically and opens a port to mqtt@home.


## Current Status

2025-02-25:

* script in link:testing/justpackets.py[]
** fetches data from controller and transmit it via mqtt
** is started via systemd, see link:systemd/tt23s.service[tt23s.service]
* nodered instance
** tries to figure out heating times
** puts the data from mqtt into an InfluxDB, display of data via simple link:influxdb/heizung.json[InfluxDB dashboard]
** also uses the data for a simple nodered dashboard
** link:nodered/flow.json[nodered flow]


## Open

* minor: which parity is actually used on the RS485 line?
* do some "simple" control
